There are different life forms in the Petri dish: bacillus, coccus, and spirillum. 
Model the life in the dish based on the following requirements:
All the species have two constants (for their meaning read further):



bacillus
coccus
spirillum
LIFE_SPAN
10
100
40
NEARBY
3
1
2

All the bacteria has a position in the dish (x, y)
Create a petri dish with one bacillus at (3, 5) and a coccus at (2, 4) to start with
There is a 'time pulse' (1 unit) in the dish that checks two aspects of all instances:
If it has reached its LIFE_SPAN, it splits into two: 2 new instances of the same 
type of life form that has died are created with random coordinates in a relative circle of radius NEARBY
The bacteria dies if some requirements do not hold:
Bacilla need at least one coccus 'nearby'
Cocci need at least two instances of bacteria of other types 'nearby'
Spirilla die if there is a bacillus 'nearby'
After in each time unit display the contents of the dish for the user to examine (console, while)

Hints: you should have an abstract class, use inheritance, data hiding and make sure there is no code re
